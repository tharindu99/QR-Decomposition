QR-Decomposition
================

QR-Decomposition real world application and analyzing the running time of QR and LU

how set up the source code..?
  source code backednd is on pythone 2.7, So before set up source code you may have to set up python  environment to your local machine.
  we use scipy library for this app so secondly you may have to set up scipy library.
  
  Then you can compile and run this app locally.
  
  1) To change real application data inputs, open source code in notepad and edit..
          go to app/main.py and open it in nodepad..
          14th line have a array named "b" change it first element value to give mid core temparature and 3rd element to  outer spare temparature....  
          then normally run main.py and see the out put open app/temparaturespheres.html in browser
          
  2) To change analysis part data inputs...
          go to analys/main.py and open it in notepad..
          38th line have "A = numpy.random.random((i*50,i*50))" line , you can change its "50" to any number, remember that always it should be a square metrix so you may have to put same number for both places..
          as same complie and see the out put open analys/graph.htm in browser
          
          
this app make for assignment, In that case I not try to do it much userfreandly.. so if you have any problem with it you can inform to me...
          
          Thanks...
